This can be done without any technical requirements on your part, just submit your suggestions, and any bugs you find, and that will be enough to participate in the contribution.

## Pull Request (PR)

PRs on any feature are welcome.

## Documentation

[Refine Tutorial](https://github.com/theme-nexmoe/docs)

As you can see, this documentation is minimal, as no one likes to write documentation. If you have plenty of time and are happy to participate in contributing, documentation is certainly a very important part of the project.
