## Statistical systems

## [Google](https://analytics.google.com)

Log into your Google Analytics admin backend, find your site - Media Resources Settings and find `Tracking ID`, which usually starts with `UA-`. Fill in the `tracking ID` into `google_site_id` or `gtags_site_id`, depending on how you want to use it. **Please note: `gtags` will need to load larger and more files. **

## CNZZ

Log into the CNZZ backend and find the code installation page, which should provide code of a form similar to the following.

```markup
<script src="//s95.cnzz.com/z_stat.php?id=<%= theme.analytics.cnzz_site_id %>&web_id={your site ID}" language="JavaScript"></script
```

Set that long list of IDs in `cnzz_site_id`.

> The content generated by the script generates "webmaster statistics", which Nexmoe has hidden.

    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
        s.parentNode.insertBefore(hm, s);
